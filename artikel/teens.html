      <h1>No Teen is Too Far GONE</h1>
      <p>
        If you would have visited the church I grew up in, one of the first
        things you would have noticed was the teenager asleep in the front
        row, bored and lifeless during the entire service — a service in which
        his dad preached. That teen was me. I grew up in a strong Christian
        home, but in my teens I turned my back on God and wanted my parents to
        leave me alone. For several years, my parents thought they had lost me
        for good. But eventually God broke through my foolish heart. He used
        my parents’ response to my rebellion to rescue me from sin, and “the
        grace of our Lord overflowed for me” (1 Timothy 1:14). There is more
        grace in Christ than there is sin in the greatest of prodigals.
        Therefore, parents should never lose hope. I am proof that no teenager
        is beyond the reach of God’s salvation.
      </p>
      <h3>Life in the Van</h3>
      <p>
        My dad and mom had hoped, as all parents do, that our family would be
        close-knit during my teenage years. They soon realized that wasn’t
        going to happen. Before their eyes, the boy who was once so sensitive
        to the things of God — the boy who showed an interest in the Bible and
        danced with his mother in church — spiraled into rebellion. During
        that time, I defined God on my own terms. I thought of God in such a
        way that he became irrelevant: a god who left me alone and didn’t have
        strong opinions about the details of my life. I told my parents I
        wanted to have regrets. I made it my ambition to ruin times together
        as a family. In conversation with my parents, my goal was to upset my
        dad and to make my mom cry. I withdrew from my parents, distancing
        myself emotionally and physically. Wherever my family went, whether it
        was family vacations, family reunions, or visiting friends, I stayed
        in the van by myself. They never left the car running, but I stayed in
        there for hours on end. One summer my parents saved up and took the
        family on a vacation to visit some national parks. One place we went
        was a breathtaking outlook at Jenny Lake in Wyoming. It is a
        magnificent, clear blue lake with the awe-inspiring Grand Teton
        Mountains towering in the background and reflecting in full color off
        the lake. Truly amazing. Or so I’ve been told. I’ve only seen a
        postcard because, in my stubbornness and folly, I was in the van.

      <h3>Encounter the Heart of God</h3>
      <p>
        My desire in life was to be left alone. Thankfully, no one did. My
        parents didn’t leave me alone, and the relentless grace of God didn’t
        leave me alone. Even when I was in my most miserable condition, I
        could never question whether my parents loved me. My parents sought
        counsel from others in the church on how to relate to me. They prayed
        for me often, because they knew that while there was nothing they
        could do that would change my heart, God is mighty to save. Rather
        than leave me to myself, they moved toward me. They set up regular
        times to meet with me and asked questions to draw me out. They
        attempted to enjoy my company, even as I was determined to make that
        difficult. They met my sin and self-absorption with mercy and
        kindness. They communicated their love for me often. They didn’t give
        up believing in the power of grace. As days and weeks and months and
        years went by, nothing seemed to be making a difference. There was no
        fruit, and it didn’t seem to my parents that anything was remotely
        helpful. When I look back on that time, though, and see my parents
        trusting God, faithfully sowing, and loving me when I was at my worst,
        I see how I came to truly understand the love of God for me through
        the love they showed.
      </p>

      <h3>A Switch Was Thrown</h3>
      <p>
        There wasn’t anything new or different that my parents did that God
        used to rescue me. In August of 1997, we were on a family vacation in
        Florida, and my parents knew we would be doing a lot of driving as a
        family. So they prepared some discussion questions based on material
        we had read. I learned later that they prepared for that trip with 76
        handwritten questions to select from as there was opportunity.
        Miraculously, God used an ordinary conversation on that vacation to
        open my eyes to see my sin, the need to repent, and the urgency of
        trusting in Christ. My dad later commented, “All of the sudden, there
        is this trip, and there is this change.” He said, “It seemed like a
        switch was thrown.” Well, that is exactly what had happened. A switch
        was thrown in my heart. God had acted and enabled me to understand who
        he is and the claim his truth has on my life. In the moment, I
        couldn’t have articulated what had happened. There were no tears, no
        confession of sin, no prayer that I prayed with my parents. But
        something had happened in my heart.
      </p>
      <h3>Don’t Give Up</h3>
      <p>
        God convicted me of sin, made Christ stunningly real to me, and gave
        me a desire to live for him. The God who said, “Let light shine out of
        darkness,” shone into my heart and gave me “the light of the knowledge
        of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ” (2 Corinthians 4:6).
        And my life would never be the same. The story of my life is one I
        love to tell because it celebrates the triumph of God’s grace.
        Parents, don’t give up. Keep praying for and loving the prodigal in
        your life. Remember that your Lord loves your children even more than
        you do. “What is impossible with man is possible with God” (Luke
        18:27). Christ “came to seek and to save the lost” (Luke 19:10), and
        he continues to bring prodigals home. Because Christ reigns with power
        and love, we can be confident there are no hopeless cases.

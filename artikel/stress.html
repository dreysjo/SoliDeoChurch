      <h1>STRESS is making me more <br />Holy or Sinful</h1>

      <p>
        Are the pressures in my life making me more holy or more unholy? And
        how would I know? This is such a great question. A lot of our emails
        come from Christians who are feeling extra pressure in life. That is
        true today in an email from a young mom named Victoria, who is facing
        the challenges of raising little ones. “Hello, Pastor John,” she
        writes. “Since becoming a mom, I have found myself battling sin like
        never before. New sins that I never recall struggling with are popping
        up, seemingly out of nowhere, especially in this season with a
        2-year-old and a newborn. My desire is to be a wife and mother to the
        glory of God, but I feel I have never been further away from this
        goal. Are these new pressures of motherhood sanctifying me or making
        me more unholy? And how can I tell the difference? Because I often
        feel as though I am becoming more unholy by them.” This is a
        tremendously important question because it gets at a reality of
        sanctification that is often overlooked — namely, that pride and
        various forms of that sin can lie latent, unseen in the forgiven,
        Spirit-indwelt Christian, often giving the impression to the Christian
        himself and to others that we are more holy than we are. I picture
        Christians in this condition like a glass of water. While the glass of
        water is very still, sitting on the counter, the sediment of pride and
        other sins can lie unnoticed at the bottom of the glass. So the water
        is clear and seems cleaner than it really is. But if you bump the
        glass — and that bumping corresponds to the pressures of motherhood,
        for example — then the sediment of pride and sin is stirred up and
        shows itself in attitudes and words and actions that show that the
        glass of water isn’t as clean as we thought it was. It’s more sinful
        than we thought. Now, that is a very important reality to come to
        terms with as a Christian. And this question forces us to come to
        terms with it — all of us, not just moms. So, I’m very glad for the
        question, even though it’s painful for us to talk about this, because,
        at least for me, I don’t like it when circumstances bump my glass and
        bring out the worst in me. Let me just state briefly seven biblical
        observations that give the foundation for this understanding of
        sanctification and how we should respond to it.
      </p>

      <h3>1. God purifies his people through trials.</h3>
      <p>
        First, God teaches us in his word that the pressures of motherhood —
        or pastoring, or any other kind of trouble or pressure, small or great
        — are designed by God for the purifying of his people. For a little
        while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials, so that
        the tested genuineness of your faith — more precious than gold that
        perishes though it is tested by fire — may be found to result in
        praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ. (1 Peter
        1:6–7) The pressures of motherhood are like a fire designed not to
        consume but to refine the gold of the mother’s faith. [God]
        disciplines us for our good, that we may share his holiness. For the
        moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it
        yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been
        trained by it. (Hebrews 12:10–11) That’s the goal of all painful or
        pressured circumstances in the Christian life: the peaceful fruit of
        righteousness, the gold of godliness refined.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Trials cause some to fall away.</h3>
      <p>
        Tribulations and pressures drive some Christians away from the faith
        forever. Jesus said in the parable of the soils, As for what was sown
        on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately
        receives it with joy, yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a
        while, and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the
        word [the glass is bumped], immediately he falls away. (Matthew
        13:20–21)
      </p>
      <h3>3. God keeps every Christian.</h3>
      <p>
        God will not let his children, his elect, fall away. He will not let
        us be tested beyond the grace he gives us to stand (1 Corinthians
        10:13). Or as it says in 1 Corinthians 1:8–9, he “will sustain you to
        the end, guiltless in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ. God is
        faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son.” Or
        Romans 8:30: “Those whom he called he also justified, and those whom
        he justified he glorified.” If he called you, he will keep you.
      </p>
      <h3>4. We may not be as godly as we think.</h3>
      <p>
        The story of Job shows that some of the most godly people have latent
        pride in their heart that certain pressures and troubles will reveal.
        The book of Job starts like this: “There was a man in the land of Uz
        whose name was Job, and that man was blameless and upright, one who
        feared God and turned away from evil” (Job 1:1). So, Job really was a
        good, godly, faithful man. He did not live in a way that brought down
        any blame on his actions. But then came the trials. At first, Job’s
        response was as good as it gets. In submission, in humility, in trust,
        he said, “The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the
        name of the Lord” (Job 1:21). But later it was more than he could
        bear, and he got angry at God. He said things like, “Why do you . . .
        count me as your enemy?” (Job 13:24). God wasn’t Job’s enemy. He
        wasn’t. This beautiful glass of water had now become cloudy. Job was
        not perfect. And the result of Job’s glass of water becoming cloudy
        with pride and anger at God was this: “I had heard of you by the
        hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees you; therefore I despise
        myself and repent in dust and ashes” (Job 42:5–6). This is repentance
        when the glass is bumped and the sediment is stirred up that nobody
        knew was there.
      </p>
      <h3>5. God exposes pride to lead us to repentance.</h3>
      <p>
        This leads to the fifth observation: God exposes the remnants of pride
        and sin in our lives so that we will do what Job did — see ourselves
        more clearly and repent more deeply.
      </p>
      <h3>6. Our sanctification can feel sluggish.</h3>
      <p>
        This means that in the process of sanctification, it often feels like
        we are going backward. This is what she asks about. Job began so well
        in chapters 1–2, and later, it wasn’t going so well. He did go
        backward, at least temporarily. It looked like Job was getting more
        unholy. So what is the answer to Victoria’s question? She says that
        the pressures of motherhood are drawing more sin out of her, as far as
        she can see.
      </p>

      <h3>7. Fight like a forgiven child of God.</h3>
      <p>
        And so my final point, my seventh observation, is an exhortation: Let
        your pressures and troubles and the apparent increase of sin, which
        really was there all along, let it all make God’s grace sweeter, and
        let it make your heart humbler, and let it make your repentance deeper
        and your warfare against sin more earnest as you fight like a forgiven
        child of God.

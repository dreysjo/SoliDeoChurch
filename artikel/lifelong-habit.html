		<h1>How to Form a Lifelong Habit</h1>
		<p>While most Christians want to read their Bibles regularly, we often fall short of integrating Scripture
			reading into the daily rhythm of our lives. We rely mostly on Christian “professionals”—pastors and
			popular Christian teachers—to teach us what we need to know about the Bible. Sitting down to read on our
			own or in a small group doesn’t seem nearly as inspirational or enjoyable. <br>

			The Bible isn’t just for “professionals,” though. It’s for all of us. When we as church leaders are
			given the privileged task of introducing new believers to the sacred practice of reading and reflecting
			on Scripture, we can change this pattern and set them up for a lifelong journey of Scripture reading.
			Here are seven essentials for getting new Christians started: </p>
		<h3>1. Offer a Way of Life, Not an Extracurricular Activity.</h3>
		<p>
			In an advertisement-driven world, we are tempted to sell spiritual disciplines to new believers. We say
			things like, “It’ll only take five minutes of your time,” and, “Just try reading a few verses a day.” I
			suppose it’s better to read for five minutes than not to read at all, but I want to suggest that we
			approach Scripture with a greater sense of gravitas, especially when it comes to introducing new
			believers to the Bible. <br>

			How we present the discipline of reading Scripture reveals its value to us. We must resist the lure of
			offering an easy, convenient, cheap form of Christianity. Being transformed by the Spirit through
			reading Scripture is not an extracurricular activity—it’s a way of life. After all, we know that we do
			“not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord” (Deut. 8:3). We are
			called to form a habit of immersing ourselves in these sacred texts until they become integrated into
			our daily lives. This is no easy task, but it is ours. Let us present it as such.
		</p>
		<h3>2. Posture Yourself as a Friend, Not an Expert.</h3>
		<p>
			One of the ways church leaders keep new believers from getting serious about Scripture is by
			unintentionally sending the message that only experts can understand God’s Word. When we present
			ourselves as biblical elites with all the right answers, we promote the idea that Bible study is for
			“the experts” rather than for all who want to enjoy fellowship with the Father. <br>

			As you introduce the Bible to new believers, posture yourself as a friend inviting someone to join you
			in the lifelong journey of exploring and being formed by Scripture. Your role as a leader is not so much
			to be a biblical scholar, but a sister or brother sharing the endless meal of communion with God’s Word.
			<br>

			To do this, read with new believers, sharing what you’re discovering in your own reading. Openly share
			your own questions and doubts. When you don’t have an answer to a question, admit you’re not sure and
			try to find the answer together. The aim here is not scholarship, but devotion and discipleship.
		</p>
		<h3>Begin with the Triune God of Love.</h3>
		<p>
			This cannot be overstated. We must not introduce Christian disciplines without introducing God. Reading
			the Bible, as with all Christian activity, begins with the Trinity, and it is done in an effort to draw
			closer to our triune God. <br>

			At the foundation of all creation and reality is this divine relationship of love. God the Father is
			pouring forth love upon God the Son; God the Son is pouring forth love on God the Father. And together,
			in love, they send the Holy Spirit that we might come to experientially know this divine interpersonal
			love (see John 14:23–31; John 15:26; Acts 2:32–33; Titus 3:3–7). <br>

			This active, alive, relational God of gracious love is seeking us. To know this God, then, is not a
			matter of information gathering, but interpersonal engagement. Our aim in reading the Bible is not only
			to hear about God, but to hear from God. Often, Christians have a bent toward utility and knowledge:
			“What can I get from this book?” To be sure, there will be plenty to learn, but the discipline of
			reading Scripture is first and foremost a means of enjoying sweet fellowship with the triune God of
			love. <br>
		</p>
		<h3>4. Name and Address the Cultural Value of Immediacy.</h3>
		<p>
			In our Google-searching, fast food, social media world, reading and reflecting on large chunks of
			literature is not natural. We have become hardwired for immediacy. But when I plan a date with my
			spouse, we make the time special by setting it aside and limiting distractions. <br>
			We must plan for our Bible reading in a similar way. As I guide new Christians in reading Scripture, I
			suggest this practical advice:<br>
		

			Create an appointment on your calendar. If it’s not on the calendar, it’s not a priority.<br>
			Find a space void of distractions. A quiet patio, a coffee shop, or even just a nice pair of
			noise-cancelling headphones will go a long way.<br>
			Turn off your cell phone. We can go off the grid for 30 minutes to be in fellowship with God.
			Use inspiring tools.<br> Get a nice study Bible, journal, highlighter, and pen that inspire you to
			engage.
		
		</p>
		<h3>5. Lead with the Gospels.</h3>
		<p>
			While all of Scripture is helpful, point new believers to the life and teachings of Jesus found in the
			Gospels. We believe that this Jewish carpenter-turned-rabbi is God in the flesh, the clearest revelation
			of God. The very essence of being Christian is knowing and imitating Jesus Christ, so begin here. <br>

			It will also be helpful to offer some overview of each Gospel. Two engaging resources I recommend are
			Eugene Peterson’s thought-provoking and inspiring introductions to each book of the Bible in The
			Message, as well as The Bible Project’s short animated summaries of each book on YouTube. These will
			offer a good primer and enough contextual background to help new believers in reading the Gospels.
		</p>
		<h3>6. Welcome Controversial Questions.</h3>
		<p>
			Any honest Bible reader is going to have questions. The Gospels, for instance, should raise some
			interesting questions about divorce, money, and how to interact with coworkers we despise. Furthermore,
			many new Christians will have questions about what Scripture has to say regarding controversial social
			issues. It's also likely that new Christians may disagree with a particular reading of the Bible. Don't
			demonize or judge; instead, engage in conversation, seeking to understand their point of view. The more
			we welcome difficult questions, the more we'll model the reality that God is big enough to handle
			whatever questions we may have.

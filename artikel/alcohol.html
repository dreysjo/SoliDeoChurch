        <h1>Is Drinking Alcohol a Sin?</h1>
        <p>
          Background Check<br />
          Let me start by putting my biases on the table — my background, my
          biases — because everybody is influenced by their family and the
          experiences they have had. I am a default teetotaler. What that means
          is if I have my choice, I don’t drink alcohol. But I might, to be a
          good guest. In other words, that is my little experience of freedom in
          Christ. But when I was in Germany, I decided that I was not going to
          make a pain of myself. If they put something on the table, I was going
          to do my best to manage it — to honor them — as a guest. I want to let
          love be the guide, and love inclines me away from alcohol in our day.
          But here is the nuanced answer, as well as a little bit of why I have
          chosen this path for myself and why I don’t make it a requirement for
          everybody.<br />
        </p>

        <h3>A Permissible Gift</h3>
        <p>
          The first answer that I would give to the question “Is it a sin to
          drink alcohol?” is the same answer I give to the question “Is it a sin
          to drink water?” And the answer is that it could be. Drinking water
          when you should be giving a glass to someone else in need — that is
          sin. Drinking water when you should be paying more reverence to the
          preaching of God’s word — that is a sin. Drinking water when someone
          just warned you that it is contaminated and might kill you — that is
          sin. So drinking water can be sin. Presumably then, alcohol could be
          sin, but it may not be. Jesus made wine for the marriage at Cana (John
          2:1–11). And I presume he made it because he expected people to drink
          it, and he didn’t want to participate in their sin. Paul told Timothy
          to drink it medicinally (1 Timothy 5:23). The church leaders are not
          to be enslaved to it, which I think implies a moderate use of it (1
          Timothy 3:8). Psalm 104:15 says it’s a gift from God: “Wine [is] to
          gladden the heart of man, oil to make his face shine and bread to
          strengthen man’s heart.” So, I don’t think anyone can make a case from
          Scripture that teetotalism is required. If you choose not to drink
          alcohol like I do, as a kind of default way of life, it needs to be
          based on some principle other than what the Bible requires of us. What
          might that be?<br />
        </p>

        <h3>Dangers in Drinking</h3>
        <p>
          is remarkable how many warnings there are in the Bible about alcohol.
          I will just bullet a few here.<br />

          <br />Ephesians 5:18, “Do not get drunk with wine.”<br />

          Romans 14:21, “It is good not to . . . drink wine or do anything that
          causes your brother to stumble.”<br />

          Hosea 4:11, “Beware of wine, and new wine, which take away the
          understanding.”<br />

          Ezekiel 44:21, “No priest shall drink wine when he enters the inner
          court.”<br />

          Proverbs 20:1, “Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler, and whoever
          is led astray by it is not wise.”<br />

          Proverbs 21:17, “He who loves wine and oil will not be rich.”<br />

          And the most extended statement in Proverbs goes like this, in chapter
          23:<br />

          Those who tarry long over wine; those who go to try mixed wine. Do not
          look at wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup and goes down
          smoothly. In the end it bites like a serpent and stings like an adder.
          Your eyes will see strange things, and your heart will utter perverse
          things. You will be like one who lies down in the midst of the sea,
          like one who lies on the top of a mast. “They struck me,” you will
          say, “but I was not hurt; they beat me, but I did not feel it. When
          shall I awake? I must have another drink.” (Proverbs 23:30–35) “Do not
          look at wine when it is red” — I don’t know what that means, except
          maybe that there is a kind of drink that is just a little too
          dangerous. Proverbs 31:4–5, “It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not
          for kings to drink wine, or for rulers to take strong drink, lest they
          drink and forget what has been decreed and pervert the rights of the
          afflicted.” Deuteronomy 29:6, “You have not drunk wine or strong
          drink, that you may know that I am the Lord your God.” The reason they
          didn’t drink any wine in the wilderness is, evidently, it would be an
          asset to their coming to know God fully. You therefore get the
          impression that even though wine was permitted and was a blessing, it
          was fraught with dangers.<br />

          Alcohol in America And I would add to those that the situation in
          which I live in America is why I feel zero incentive to try to like
          and enjoy alcoholic beverages. I am very content without them, and
          here is what I have in mind. I did my ministry for thirty years at
          Bethlehem, just a few blocks away from Teen Challenge. Every Saturday
          night (virtually), some of those guys — who were in there to be set
          free from their addiction to alcohol — would show up, and they would
          come forward for prayer. Their stories were simply tragic, and I was
          thrilled for them to get free. So I watched it destroy lives, and I
          watched the lives being rebuilt minus alcohol. I looked on Google
          yesterday: Alcohol costs Americans two hundred billion dollars a year,
          according to the Center for Disease Control Prevention. That is $750
          per American in health costs and work production costs because of
          alcohol. One-third of all traffic fatalities owe to alcohol
          involvement — and so on, with most of the ills of our culture. You can
          read statistics on divorce and abuse and so on. Not to mention that it
          makes people babbling fools on airplanes so that they get very, very
          annoying.
        </p>

        <h3>Know the Book (and Yourself)</h3>
        <p>
          By the way, nowhere in the New Testament is the communion drink called
          “wine.” Now, it probably was. I am not arguing it wasn’t. It probably
          was. But isn’t it interesting that nowhere is communion called “wine”?
          It is usually called the cup, or it is called the fruit of the vine.
          So, nobody can insist that we are commanded to drink wine by being
          commanded to drink the Lord’s Supper. Given the fact that the Bible is
          mainly cautious about it, I don’t have any desire for it. And God has
          given many other drinks that don’t have the same kind of addictive and
          destructive side effects. What I would like to say is: I am saving the
          best for last. I am saving the best for when I can handle it — and I
          know I am a man with an addictive personality. I buy a pack of gum,
          and I chew the whole thing in five minutes. So knowing myself, knowing
          this culture that is being destroyed in measure by it, I find little
          incentive myself for pursuing something I have no desire to pursue.
          And let me end by just saying I do not condemn those who make other
          choices. It is just not on my agenda to go on a crusade to get other
          people to join me in this. I am just explaining where I am coming
          from.
